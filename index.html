            <p>
              Ilorin Women Association (IWA) is the brainchild of some female
              indigenes of Ilorin who are desirous of making a positive impact
              on the community and its citizens. Founded in 2015, the group is
              poised to fill noticeable gaps in the development of the
              community, especially those that concern women and children.
            </p>
            <p>
              What began as a small gathering of passionate women has grown into

              women and advancing our community.

            <b>Dr. Lawal Olohungbebe</b> (also spelled Olohungbebe or Olalekan
            Olohungbebe) serves as the Honourable Commissioner for Education and
            Human Capital Development in Kwara State, Nigeria. Recent reports
            confirm his emergence as Chairman of the Committee of State
            Commissioners of Education (COSCEN), marked by his official takeover
            of the organization's new national secretariat in Abuja. <br />

            <strong>Background and Achievements </strong><br />
            Appointed commissioner in March 2025, Dr. Olohungbebe previously
            held roles like Senior Special Assistant on Community Development
            and Director at Kwara State University's Centre for Community
            Development. Various groups, including the Sardauna Ilory Movement,
            have congratulated him, highlighting his dedication to education
            reforms.
            <br />

            <strong>COSCEN Significance</strong><br />
            COSCEN coordinates Nigeria's state education commissioners to align
            with federal policies, promote innovations, and enhance human
            capital development. The new Abuja secretariat strengthens
            federal-state ties, peer learning, and reforms for consistent
            educational quality. <br />

            <h3>Oloje Market Environmental Cleanup</h3>
            <p>
              In our commitment to environmental sustainability and community
              health, IWA organized a comprehensive cleanup exercise at Oloje
              Market, one of Ilorin's busiest commercial centers. This
              initiative was part of our broader environmental advocacy program
              aimed at promoting cleanliness and proper waste management
              practices in public spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cleanup exercise involved over 100 IWA members and volunteers
              who worked tirelessly to clear drainage systems, remove
              accumulated waste, and educate market traders on the importance of
              maintaining a clean environment. The project also included
              distribution of waste bins and educational materials on proper
              waste disposal.
            </p>
            <p>
              This initiative not only improved the sanitary conditions of the
              market but also raised awareness about environmental health among
              traders and shoppers, contributing to a healthier community for
              all. The success of this project has inspired similar initiatives
              in other markets across Ilorin.
